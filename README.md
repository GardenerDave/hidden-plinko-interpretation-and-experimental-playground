## Project Summary

The *Hidden Plinko Interpretation (HPI)* is a dynamic simulation and theoretical model exploring the idea that quantum probability may emerge from deterministic substrate dynamics.

By simulating particle-like "pucks" falling through hidden symmetry structures, this platform allows exploration of:

* Substrate-level biases and asymmetries
* External field effects on drift and spread
* Time-evolving constraint geometries
* Statistical emergence from hidden determinism

The project combines interactive experimentation with an evolving manuscript detailing a unifying theory of quantum-classical behavior via **symmetry locking, informational torsion, and the interface manifold**.

## Key Features

* Dynamic hidden symmetry types (rotational, elliptical, mirrored, randomized, etc.)
* Configurable external field influence
* Real-time or batch-mode puck simulations
* Parameter sweep logging and export support
* Deterministic simulations yielding probabilistic-looking outputs
* Fully modifiable Jupyter-based playground
