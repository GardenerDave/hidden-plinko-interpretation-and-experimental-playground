## Hidden Plinko Interpretation v1.1

This release expands the experimental and theoretical foundation of the Hidden Plinko Interpretation—our deterministic substrate model for emergent quantum statistics.

### Paper
- Updated: [`Hidden_Plinko_Interpretation_v1.1.pdf`](arXiv_submission/Hidden_Plinko_Interpretation_v1.1.pdf)
- Expanded mathematical formalism: entropy dynamics, drift modeling, Fokker–Planck analogy
- New figures and interpretations added from recent simulations

### Experiments
- Entropy-based analysis of collapse structure under dynamic fields
- Harmonic mode sweeps with peak correlation and bifurcation emergence
- Collapse Landscape mapping (symmetry strength vs. attractor behavior)
- Galaxy rotation analogs and spiral symmetry evolution
- Oscillating field studies with FFT-based resonance detection
- 1000+ total CSVs included in the `Exports/` and `Experiments/` folders

### Tools and Templates
- `experiment_format/` includes structured upload templates and parameter guides
- `Experiments/` folder includes curated datasets referenced in the paper
- All batch exports reproducibly generated from the simulator

### What’s New
- Collapse surface visualizations and entropy overlays
- Drift reversal and force symmetry analogs
- Emergent spiral and harmonic patterns under deterministic rules
