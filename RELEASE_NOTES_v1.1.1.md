# Hidden Plinko Interpretation â€“ Release Notes (v1.1.1)

**Release Date:** 2025-06-16
**Version:** v1.1.1 â€“ Theory Finalization and Documentation

---

## âœ¨ Summary

This patch release introduces important theoretical additions and final documentation refinements following the main v1.1 rollout.

While no new simulation batches are included, the theoretical foundation of the project has been strengthened significantly through the addition of two new manuscript sections and supporting documentation improvements.

## ðŸ“˜ Key Additions

### ðŸ”· Section 4.6.2 â€“ Informational Torsion

Introduces a new geometric mode of constraint propagation in the informational substrate, describing rotational influence as a complement to curvature. Torsion fields are proposed as potential carriers of directional bias and structural stabilization.

### ðŸ”· Section 4.10 â€“ Interface Manifold

Proposes that interference patterns may represent tomographic projections of higher-dimensional symmetry structures. The interface manifold is framed as a dynamic field boundary linking probabilistic quantum statistics and relativistic geometries.

### ðŸ“„ README.md (Updated)

* Completely rewritten to reflect the scope and depth of both simulation and theory components
* Features clear install and usage instructions
* Highlights core theoretical contributions and simulation architecture
* Includes embedded links to the v1.1 manuscript

### ðŸ“‘ CHANGELOG.md (Created)

* All versioned project changes are now logged clearly for traceability
* Future releases will append to this record to ensure reproducibility and transparency

---

## ðŸ”„ Modified

* The final manuscript (v1.1) was updated to incorporate torsion and interface manifold sections
* README revised for clarity, formatting, and alignment with project structure

---

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps

* v1.2 (planned): Additional experiment batches exploring torsion-induced drift and symmetry-wrapped curvature effects
* Potential preprint/publication push following DOI assignment and early feedback cycle
