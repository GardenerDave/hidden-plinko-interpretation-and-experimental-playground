abstract: >
  This paper presents a computational framework in which quantum-like statistical behaviors emerge from
  deterministic substrate dynamics. By simulating the evolution of a hidden-variable medium under internal
  symmetry constraints and external field modulation, we recover key features of quantum mechanics including
  interference, collapse analogs, and entropic asymmetries. Sixteen structured experiments explore bifurcations,
  decoherence-like processes, and holographic boundary behaviors. The framework, called the Hidden Plinko
  Interpretation, provides a testable pathway for modeling emergent quantum statistics without fundamental
  indeterminism.
